How to use the map you ask?
You have three images and three layers.

The first image is based before the conflict take place
The second image is based just after insects start attacking
The third image is right now, the conflict is now

The first layer, "Levels", contains every levels in the game (each black dot is a level and the black line is liaison)
The second layer, "Insects", contains information about insect species in a specific area: Red for Huta, Green for Unt and Grey for Blusim
The fourth layer, "Map", is the plain map
