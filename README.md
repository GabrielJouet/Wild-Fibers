# Wild-Fibers
Tower defense game about insects against plants, made by two developers from Wild Box Studio.

By controlling "squads" (a group of four towers) you will have to fight back against an army of various insects: crawly, slimy and earthy alike. 
Each level will have its own environnement, enemies and characteristics and they will put you on the test. 
From Fields to Caverns, you will explore Marshes and way more to come.
